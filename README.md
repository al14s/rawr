  RAWR is a python tool that is designed to make the process of web enumeration easy and efficient by
providing pertinent information in usable formats.  It uses NMap(live or from
file), Metasploit, Qualys, Nexpose, or Nessus scan data to target web services
for enumeration, then visits each host on each port with an identified web
service and gathers as much data as possible.
